## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<img style="float: left;" src="luvnalia/readme/images/nnaliam.png"> This mod adds a complete romance with Nalia, including the tree of life dialogs, beloved one in danger, Nalia's abduction by Bodhi, and other love related quests. It also adds some new quests and character interactions.<br><br>
Having Minsc in the party is recommended... :wink:<br><br>

<details><summary><ins>Original note from Sir BillyBob</ins></summary>
<p>

###### I simply decided that I wanted another mod to add to my game, so I converted this mod from its original format (which made it incompatible with everything else).

###### You can install it at any time after patching your SoA/ToB game.

###### The idea here is that older mods, whether TeamBG's TBG format or IAP or even older WeiDU mods, will get a refresh to become more compatible with other mods.

###### So what is here? Well, any mod that I can "fix". Mods that don't seem to be supported by their owner anymore, and mods that you all ask me to update. The last one doesn't mean that every old mod out there can be updated. I do have one I have updated that isn't here. The owner is hosting on their own site (which is fine since it is his mod, not mine).
</p>
</details><br>

**Note:** This is a WeiDU-based version of the original mod that was first released at <a href="http://web.starman.ee/arnel/nalia/">starman.ee</a>. As this site is no more available since many years, it was time to save it from disappearance. It is now hosted at Spellhold Studios with Arnel authorization.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games:

- Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE).
- The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. **Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.** Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.
- The conversion projects based on ToB: <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy</a> (EET).

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/278-sir-bbs-revisions/">report them on the forum</a>!

:warning: Don't install Arnel's Nalia Romance Revision alongside with the <a href="https://www.pocketplane.net/dearnise-romance/">de'Arnise Romance mod</a> (from jcompton and Kulyok) hosted at the Pocket Plane Group, because installing two dedicated PC/Nalia romances would be a poor idea.

## 

#### Installation Order

>Original game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Arnel's Nalia Romance Revision after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, Ascension and EET.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-luvnalia.exe`__, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __luvnalia__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old save games. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Arnel's Nalia Romance Revision for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: luvnalia folder and a setup-luvnalia.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-luvnalia.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-luvnalia.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS

Arnel's Nalia Romance Revision for Mac OS is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: luvnalia folder, setup-luvnalia and setup-luvnalia.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-luvnalia.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-luvnalia.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Arnel's Nalia Romance Revision for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-luvnalia`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-luvnalia --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
